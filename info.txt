If we used 'impersonate_service_account', we need to authenticate locally with gcloud

 $  gcloud auth application-default login

This gives us a command we have to use to run outside of WSL in a browser so we can login to get an access token (using the real user account). 

This gives us a command we run back in the WSL shell to set the application defaults (~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json)

We also need to grant access from  real user account to the service account with 'roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator' although it may also 
just work if you have the Editor global role.

Or for testing, just get the Keys from the service account and used the 'credentials' option instead !!!

The token only last for a few hours and then dies. To clear it sooner, type:

$ gcloud auth application-default revoke

Note that if the user account has the rights anyway (editor) then it doesn't need the service account to impersonate !!!
